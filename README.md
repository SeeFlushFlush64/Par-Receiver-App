# Par-Receiver-App
I have used ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-blue) to make the user interface of this mobile app. 
For my backend, I have used ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-yellow) since it is a BaaS (Backend as a Service)
CRUD Mobile Application for registering COD and Non-COD parcels. Registered parcels will be the basis of transaction for the Par-Receiver machine.

Warning: I have deleted my firebase_options.dart and google_services.json since they include sensitive information (secrets).
Those informations are needed by the application to work.

Here is an [Audio-Visual Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YCKJfx-oJFWOlZKkQbCbiCAsmtDB7QLt/view?usp=sharing) on how the Par-Receiver Machine and App works together.

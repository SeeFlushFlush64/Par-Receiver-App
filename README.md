CRUD Mobile Application for registering COD and Non-COD parcels. Registered parcels will be the basis of transaction for the Par-Receiver machine.

Warning: I have deleted my firebase_options.dart and google_services.json since they include sensitive information (secrets).
Those informations are needed by the application to work.

Here is an [Audio-Visual Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YCKJfx-oJFWOlZKkQbCbiCAsmtDB7QLt/view?usp=sharing) on how the Par-Receiver Machine and App works together.
